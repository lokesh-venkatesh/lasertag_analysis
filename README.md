I did some fun analysis with data from a real life game of lasertag I played with a group of old friends from high school. This was on the 25th of May, 2025 in Coimbatore. Everything's been compiled in a Valorant-style stats-display in the python notebook analysis.ipynb in this repo. The stats follow exactly the same list of metrics as given below:

1. Total Kills per Player – Count of times each player tagged others.
2. Total Deaths per Player – Count of times each player got tagged.
3. K/D Ratio – Kills divided by deaths for each player.
4. Most Kills – Player(s) with the highest number of tags.
5. Most Deaths – Player(s) tagged the most.
6. Least Kills – Player(s) with the fewest kills.
7. Least Deaths – Player(s) who got hit the least.
8. Longest Kill Streak – Longest sequence of kills without dying.
9. Longest Time Alive – Longest time span without getting tagged.
10. Fastest Kill After Spawn – Shortest time between getting tagged and tagging someone back.
11. Most Consecutive Hits on Same Player – Who bullied whom the most in a row.
12. Kill Timeline Graph – Time series showing each player’s kills over time.
13. Death Timeline Graph – Same, but for getting tagged.
14. Who Killed Whom – A matrix or list showing all kill interactions.
15. Rivalries – Pairs that exchanged the most tags between them.
16. One-Sided Duels – Pairs where one player dominated (e.g., 10–0).
17. Most Kills on One Player – Who targeted one person the most.
18. "Sharpshooter" – Best K/D ratio.
19. "Ghost" – Least deaths.
20. "Tank" – Most deaths but still had kills.
21. "Revenge Master" – Most revenge kills (killed someone who just killed them).
22. "Comeback King" – Longest kill streak after a death streak.
23. "Aggressor" – Highest kill rate per minute.
24. "Survivor" – Longest average time between deaths.
25. "Focused Fury" – Most kills on the same player in a row.

A video of what the game looks like IRL can be found in lasertag.mp4 in this repo.
